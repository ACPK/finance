*finance* - a library for financial calculations in Ruby.

= OVERVIEW


= ABOUT

I began developing _finance_ while writing a Ruby script for analyzing
mortgages.  I couldn't find an existing resource for these tools, I am
hoping to save other folks some time by releasing what I have as a gem.

= INSTALL

+$ sudo gem install finance+
