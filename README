_finance_ - a library for financial calculations in Ruby.

= INSTALL

	$ sudo gem install finance

= OVERVIEW

== GETTING STARTED

	>> require 'finance'

== AMORTIZATION

You are interested in borrowing $250,000 under a 30 year, fixed-rate loan with a 4.25% APR.

	>> rate = Rate.new(0.0425, :apr, :duration => 30.years)
	>> amortization = 250000.amortize(rate)

Find the standard monthly payment:

	>> amortization.payment
	=> DecNum('-1229.91')

Find the total cost of the loan:

	>> amortization.payments.sum
	=> DecNum('-442766.55')

How much will you pay in interest?

	>> amortization.interest.sum
	=> DecNum('192766.55')

How much interest in the first six months?

	>> amortization.interest[0,6].sum
	=> DecNum('5294.62')

= ABOUT

I began developing _finance_ while writing a Ruby script for analyzing
mortgages.  I couldn't find an existing resource for these tools, I am
hoping to save other folks some time by releasing what I have as a gem.

If you have used _finance_ and find it useful, I would enjoy hearing
about it!

= FEATURES

Currently implemented features include:

* Fixed-rate mortgage amortization (30/360).
* Interest rates
* Various cash flow computations, such as NPV, IRR, and sum.

Planned features include:

* Adjustable rate mortgage amortization.
* Payment modifications (i.e., how does paying an additional $75 per
month affect the amortization?)
* Balloon payments.
* Support for amortization methods other than 30/360.
