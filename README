*finance* - a library for financial calculations in Ruby.

= INSTALL

	$ sudo gem install finance

= OVERVIEW

== GETTING STARTED

	>> require 'finance'

== AMORTIZATION

You are interested in borrowing $250,000 under a 30 year, fixed-rate loan with a 4.25% APR.

	>> rate = Rate.new :apr => 0.0425, :duration => 30.years
	>> amortization = 250000.amortize(rate)

Find the standard monthly payment:

	>> amortization.payment
	=> DecNum('-1229.91')

Find the total cost of the loan:

	>> amortization.payments.sum
	=> DecNum('-442766.55')

How much will you pay in interest?

	>> amortization.interest.sum
	=> DecNum('192766.55')

How much interest in the first six months?

	>> amortization.interest[0,6].sum
	=> DecNum('5294.62')

= ABOUT

I began developing *finance* while writing a Ruby script for analyzing
mortgages.  I couldn't find an existing resource for these tools, I am
hoping to save other folks some time by releasing what I have as a gem.
