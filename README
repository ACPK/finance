= ABOUT

The goal of the _finance_ library is to provide Ruby implementations
of common financial formulas, with a function syntax similar to most
modern spreadsheet programs.  As the project matures, consideration will
also be given to providing useful, but more advanced functions, which
may not be suitable for a spreadsheet environment but are useful when
programming.

I began developing _finance_ while writing a Ruby script for analyzing
mortgages.  I couldn't find an existing resource for these tools, I am
hoping to save other folks some time by releasing what I have as a gem.
